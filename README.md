Modify the README.md file associated with your submission, with answers for the following questions. (20 points)
What is the purpose of this program(s)? **The purpose of the first section of code is to determine all the prime numbers between 2 and
and the number given by the user. The second portion of code is designed to ask the user for a number of rows that they would like
to be included in a generation of pascals triangle**
What does this program take as input? **Both sections of the code take their input from the user**
What is the expected out put of the program? **The expected outputs include a list of prime numbers between 2 and a given number,
as well as a generation of pascals triangle with intergers and a number of rows that was given by the user**
What type of execution is included in your program? **Sqqeuential and Conditional**
How could your program be improved? **I think the best way to improve the program would be through the use of functions, specifically one too calcaulte the
triangle value, and another one to print the triangle. It might be also be good to implement a check to make sure that the formatting is correct.**
